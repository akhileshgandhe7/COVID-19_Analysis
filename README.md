In the current situation of COVID-19 becoming a pandemic there’s an utmost need for us to understand the various aspects of it. 
Be it medical issues, travel or the safety precautions its very important for us to understand what’s happening in and around 
the world to be aware so that we & everyone around us will be happy & safe. With high influx of information in the social media 
it has become very difficult to know the ground reality. So, in this context analysing the real-world data coming in is a good 
sign what we felt of. For this we have taken a dataset of US & Canada airport waiting time related & done some Exploratory Data Analysis. 
Now let’s have a look into it.

Insights from the EDA:
######################
-> Number of people who travelled from US to Canada & Canada to US are approximately same as it might be all the people who went on some work returned home.
-> Average time taken in weekdays is 7 and weekends is 8 as most people might have holidays on the weekends.
-> In weekdays as well as weekends for more than 55% people time taken is more than 5hrs.
-> The percentage of people who travelled in the evenings are around 38% followed by afternoon 25%.
-> Number of people travelled got decreased a bit from Jan to Feb but from Feb to March it covered up and in April its very less that is 3.1% that might be due to lockdown in countries
-> Top 5 airports where the average time taken in more than 5hrs are Windsor-Ambasador bridge, Samia, Fort Erie, Queenston, St.Bernard & that of America are Port Huron, Deteroit ambassador bridge, Buffalo, Lewiston, Champaign
-> In Canada for all 4 months of Jan, Feb, March & April most of the times the highest time taken in the Huntingdon & Andover airports
-> In America 95% of the times the most time taken airport is Alexandria bay followed by Alcan & Antler ports.
-> In all the 4 months the traffic was more during the week4 of every month and so the more time taken.
